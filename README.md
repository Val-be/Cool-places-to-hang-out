# Hangout app #
## Project nÂ°2 with Ironhack ##

 This app allows you to share places you like to hangout in, be it for a picnic, to see a public representation, or just to grab a drink with friends ! Find places near you using geolocation !

 You can comment places, add them to your favorites and even post places of your own. Geolocation is automatically included when you enter a valid address.
